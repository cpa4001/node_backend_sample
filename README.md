## Levvel Technical Interview

### Project Setup

- Fork the repository and clone the repository to your local machine. Documentation on how to do this https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo
- open the project locally
- Create a branch using the naming convention **yourFirstName_yourLastName**. This is where you work should be saved.
- The application will start on http://localhost:3001

## Existing State

This is a simple node application for serving a blog.<br>
It uses Express Framework, Mongoose, and data is stored in a Mongo database.

Currently the application has 2 endpoints:

1. To add a blog post - Post at /blog/post
2. To get a blog post by id - Get at /blog/:id

## Task

Your task is to add a commenting feature.

You should add two new endpoints.

1. Post at /blog/post/{1}/comment - which should create a new comment for a post with passed {id}

2. Get at /blog/post/{1}/comment - which should return all comments for a post with passed {id}
   Under the resources folder are example json files for both a Blog and a Comment.

Feel free to modify existing files or create new files. You may add new dependencies if you choose. Please follow the conventions in place throughout the project.

### Please spend no more than 4 hours on this task

## Submitting Your Work (IMPORTANT)

When you are finished, create a Pull Request in Github for the forked repository. This Pull Request should compare your created branch to the **main** branch. Email the link to your Pull Request to nicole.niemczycki@endava.com at least 24 hours prior to your technical interview

Please make sure your Pull Request is for your forked repo, NOT the original repo
